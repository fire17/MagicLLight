# [Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com)

## v0.5.0 :: 20230324

- Add support for Brave thanks to @chrisgavin!
- Add support for Slack thanks to @hraftery!
- Migrate config to pyproject.toml alone
- Minor cleanup to codebase and tests

## v0.4.7 :: 20210826

- No noteworthy API changes, hence the bugfix version bump, but some major
  infrastructure and testing updates:
    - Now uses GitHub Actions instead of Travis
    - Now uses Playwright for testing, to actually open a Chromium instance and
    use a real `Cookies` database
    - PEP517
    - black
- Now requires python >= 3.7
    - This is largely due to requiremets of Playwright:
      https://pypi.org/project/playwright/, which is only a *test* dependency
    - Because I can't *test* with <=3.6, I'm not listing it as compatible,
      though it *probably* will still work
- Migrate to pyproject.toml
